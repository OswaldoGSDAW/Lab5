## What I didn't know

**Property and Costs:** GitHub is owned by Microsoft, while Bitbucket is owned by Atlassian. GitHub offers a free plan for public repositories, whereas Bitbucket offers free private repositories for small teams.

**Project Management Features:** GitHub offers tools like Projects and Issues for project management and issue tracking. Bitbucket also has similar features, but GitHub is more renowned for these tools.
